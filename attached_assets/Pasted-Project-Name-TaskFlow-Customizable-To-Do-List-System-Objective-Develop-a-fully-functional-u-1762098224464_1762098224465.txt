Project Name:
TaskFlow – Customizable To-Do List System

🧩 Objective

Develop a fully functional, user-ready MVP for a Customizable To-Do List App that allows users to create, manage, and personalize tasks with flexibility, real-time syncing, and smart productivity features. The app must be modular, scalable, and responsive across all devices.

⚙️ Core MVP Features
1. User System

✅ Email & password authentication (Sign up, Login, Logout, Forgot password)

✅ OAuth login (Google, optional for MVP phase 2)

✅ User profile section (editable name, theme preference, avatar)

✅ Secure backend authentication (JWT or Firebase Auth)

2. Task Management

✅ Create, edit, mark as complete/incomplete, delete, and restore tasks

✅ Add optional subtasks (nested up to 2 levels)

✅ Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

✅ Add due date, time, and reminders

✅ Optional recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly, custom)

✅ Task progress tracking (percentage completion for lists and subtasks)

✅ Bulk selection and action (delete, complete, move to folder)

3. Customizable Lists & Categories

✅ Users can create custom folders or categories (e.g., Work, Personal, School, etc.)

✅ Each category can have its own color, icon, and background

✅ Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks and categories

4. Smart Filters & Sorting

✅ Filters: Today, Upcoming, Completed, Overdue

✅ Sort by: Priority, Due Date, Date Created, Alphabetical

✅ Search bar with live filtering

5. UI / UX Requirements

✅ Minimal, clean, and responsive layout (mobile-first but adaptive to desktop)

✅ Two main screens: “Dashboard” and “Task Details”

✅ Light/Dark mode toggle

✅ Option to customize font size and color themes

✅ Modern iconography and rounded UI components

6. Notifications & Reminders

✅ Local notification support for due dates

✅ Daily summary reminder option (“You have X tasks today”)

7. Data Storage

✅ Cloud-based storage (Firebase Firestore, Supabase, or MongoDB Atlas)

✅ Real-time sync across devices

✅ Offline caching and auto-sync when connection resumes

8. Settings

✅ Change display mode (Light/Dark/Auto)

✅ Manage notification preferences

✅ Reset all data (with confirmation dialog)

✅ Backup/restore user data manually

🧠 Additional MVP Enhancements (If Time Permits)

AI task suggestions (“Would you like to repeat this task next week?”)

Natural language task input (e.g., “Meet John tomorrow at 3 PM”)

Analytics dashboard (task completion stats, streaks, productivity score)

Widget or Quick Add shortcut on mobile

🧪 Technical Stack Recommendation

Frontend: React (Next.js optional), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

Backend: Firebase or Node.js + Express

Database: Firebase Firestore / MongoDB

Auth: Firebase Auth / JWT

Notifications: OneSignal or native browser notifications

Deployment: Replit, Vercel, or Netlify (for MVP)

🧰 Functional Requirements

Must be fully interactive and data-persistent (not a static prototype).

Every function (add/edit/delete) must immediately reflect in the UI.

Must have error handling and validation (e.g., task title required).

Backend must be secured from unauthorized access.

📊 Admin Dashboard (Optional for MVP Phase 2)

Overview of total users, total tasks, completion rate

Option to send broadcast announcements or system updates

✅ MVP Completion Criteria

All core features fully functional, tested, and bug-free

Responsive UI verified across major screen sizes

Authentication + data persistence confirmed

Ready to deploy on live hosting (Replit or Vercel)

🪄 Prompt Goal

“Generate a fully functional, professional MVP of TaskFlow, a customizable to-do list web app that includes all the features listed above. Ensure real backend connectivity, editable task lists, and user customization options. The output must be Replit-ready and immediately usable as a live app, not a prototype.”
